Ingredients
===========

1/2 recipe homemade pizza crust
1/2 cup (127g) pizza sauce, or more depending how much you like (homemade or store-bought)
1 and 1/2 cups (6oz or 168g) shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup (75g) cooked ham or Canadian bacon, sliced or chopped
1/2 cup (82g) pineapple chunks (canned or fresh)
3 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled

Directions
==========

1. Prepare the pizza dough through step 11, including preheating the oven to 475F as described in step 8.

2. After waiting 15 minutes as described in step 11, top with pizza sauce, then the mozzarella cheese,
then the ham/Canadian bacon, and pineapple. Sprinkle with bacon crumbles.

3. Bake for 14-16 minutes or until the crust is lightly browned and the cheese is bubbling. For the
last minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That's optional. Remove
from the oven. Slice pizza and serve immediately. Store leftover pizza covered tightly in the
refrigerator and reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices may be frozen up to 1 month.
